# Pypad

Pypad is a PySide6 desktop text editor focused on fast note-taking and power-user workflows.

Creator's Thoughts
- You might wonder why my naming is like the other project with same names, i think i named it on my own since it's a great way despite all the mess...
- Warning: This project is only maintained during my free time, so please expect some delays or even makes the project being abondoned over 12 months.
- I know some features are experimental, so please expect bugs, unresponsive apps, tracebacks, and errors. It's on prerelease state in my project actually.

Highlights:
- Soft modern rounded UI overhaul with token-based theming
- Multi-tab editor with detachable tabs, pin/favorite states, and rich tab actions
- Quick Open / Go to Anything (`Ctrl+Alt+P`) with file, line, symbol, workspace-symbol, and command modes
- AI chat dock with one-click apply actions (Insert/Replace/Append/New Tab/Replace File/Diff)
- Markdown tools + live preview, syntax modes, workspace search, autosave/recovery, version history
- Preferences with unified PyPad + Notepad++ compatibility pages
- Visual UI regression tooling (screenshot smoke tests + baseline compare CI)
