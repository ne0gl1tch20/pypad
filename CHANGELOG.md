# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project uses Semantic Versioning.


## [1.7.7-prerelease] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Quiz mode restored and expanded in the editor:
  - mixed-format parser for MCQ, True/False, and short-answer blocks
  - metadata formats accepted: `{answer:X}`, `[answer=X]`, `(correct: X)`, `{keywords: ...}`
  - `{user}` / `[user]` answer anchors (above or below question)
  - status-bar quiz controls: `Quit` and `Finish`
  - detailed scoring dialog (totals, type totals, per-question rows)
- Quiz format help dialog restored to a full detailed guide with examples and scoring notes.
- Dedicated quiz tests added (`tests/test_quiz_mode.py`) covering parser/scoring/placeholder behavior.
- AI panel quick-action UX restored:
  - `+` action menu with SVG icons
  - Add Files file-picker attachment flow
  - inline status row (`Status: Idle/Thinking/Streaming/Error`)

### Changed
- Quiz placeholder placement now prefers the first non-option line under each question for cleaner alignment.
- Parser now avoids non-gradable help bullets and marker-only sample lines to prevent visual ghost artifacts.
- Theme restart behavior remains explicit-only (`Reload App`) instead of automatic app-close restart.

### Fixed
- Preferences save/theme changes no longer trigger unintended app close.
- Cached settings-dialog reset flag is now cleared before each open to prevent accidental factory-reset close path.
- Added temporary close-event trace logging to capture shutdown trigger path in logs.

## [1.7.6-prerelease] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- Settings dialog: LSP server preference fields for Python/JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Settings dialog: factory reset action with explicit confirmation (resets defaults and closes app).
- PySide6-native Scintilla compatibility engine (`scintilla_compat.py`) used when `PySide6.Qsci` is unavailable.
- Margin rendering and interactions:
  - fold glyphs, marker glyphs, line numbers
  - per-margin width/type/mask/sensitivity handling
  - margin click signaling by margin index
- Marker symbol family support for compatibility backend (circle/arrow/plus/minus/rect/empty variants).
- Indicator and hotspot primitives:
  - indicator ranges with style variants and colors
  - hotspot ranges with payloads and hover/click signals
  - indicator hover/click signals with payloads
- Lightweight calltip/annotation API compatibility methods.
- Richer lexer-style token overlays for Python/JS/TS/JSON/Markdown in compat mode.

### Changed
- LSP go-to-definition client hardening:
  - configurable initialize/request timeouts
  - per-server retry attempts
  - optional verbose LSP event logging
  - server preference order respected from settings
- Tuned default LSP settings based on smoke timings:
  - initialize timeout: `2.5s`
  - request timeout: `2.0s`
  - retries: `2`
- Editor fallback behavior no longer degrades to plain QTextEdit-only mode; advanced editor actions are routed through compatibility backend.
- Column (rectangular) editing now persists block selection across compatible edits in column mode.
- Multi-caret workflows improved:
  - synchronized backspace/delete
  - synchronized navigation (`Left`/`Right`/`Home`/`End`)
  - row-aware multi-paste behavior
- Folding behavior expanded:
  - indentation + bracket-guided fold region detection
  - fold-all/fold-line/fold-level support in compat mode
- Visual symbol toggles (`space/tab`, `EOL`, `control`, `indent guides`, `wrap`) now render in compat backend.

### Fixed
- Windows server command parsing now handles quoted executable paths with spaces for LSP server settings.
- Removed hard dependency on importing `PySide6.Qsci` for bookmark marker symbol setup in fallback mode.
- Restored syntax/search/line-style overlays for compatibility backend by distinguishing native-vs-compat Scintilla handling.

## [1.7.4-prerelease] - 2026-02-26

- A BIG UPDATE! (yet!)

### Added
- Shared token-based UI theme system used across main window chrome, dialogs, Quick Open, and AI Chat surfaces.
- Quick Open / Go to Anything upgrades:
  - `@symbol`, `@@symbol`, `@w symbol`, and scoped `@@filepattern symbol`
  - background file/symbol indexing and persistent caches
  - grouped result sections and `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` mode cycling
  - live incremental refresh while indexing

  - Insert / Replace Selection / Append / New Tab
  - Replace Whole File
  - Open Diff Preview

  - offscreen screenshot smoke captures
  - HTML manifest (`tests_tmp/visual_smoke_phase2/index.html`)
  - baseline compare/update mode with perceptual hash threshold
  - committed baseline file and CI gate
- CI workflow split for UI checks:
  - fast UI theme/dialog tests

### Changed
- App UI overhauled to a soft modern rounded style across core chrome:
  - tabs, toolbars, menus, docks, status bar, scrollbars
- High-traffic dialogs and panels aligned to the new theme language:
  - Settings, Tutorial, Autosave, Workspace dialogs, AI edit preview/rewrite, Debug Logs, updater dialogs
- Additional custom/niche dialogs now use shared dialog theming (Windows Manager, macro run dialog, open-source licenses, clipboard/jump/search results/history panels, user guide, document summary, and others).
- `User Defined Language` dialog now uses token-based dialog styling instead of a local hardcoded dark/light stylesheet.
- `main_window` package export changed to lazy `Notepad` import to avoid circular import issues in UI tests/fixtures.

- `apply_settings()` hover-mode tab-close theming ordering bug (`tab_close_icon_url` used before assignment).
- `apply_settings()` hover close-button QSS f-string brace escaping bug causing runtime `NameError` in hover mode.
- Quick Open incremental refresh now detects same-count updates using content signatures/hashes.

## [1.7.2-prerelease] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- Startup file opening now keeps the first file active instead of switching to the last.

### Fixed

### Changed
- Reassigned Pin Tab shortcut from `Ctrl+Shift+P` to `Ctrl+Alt+P` to avoid conflict with Command Palette.

  - converted to right-edge overlay button instead of regular toolbar action
  - dynamic hidden-tools menu now uses proxy actions for reliable text entries.

### Fixed
- Prevented startup/runtime crashes from stale/deleted Qt action wrappers (`QWidgetAction` / `QAction`) by adding defensive `RuntimeError` guards in shortcut and tooltip/action wiring paths.
